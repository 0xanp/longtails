# Single State: A Better IBC Bridge

As the demand grows for different Web3 blockchains, the need for cross-chain interopability grows with every passing second. While every person will have some level of preference about what network they utilize as well as what protocols they use on that network. Regardless the network, there is generally little reason that capital should not be operating in a cross-network state.

* If you have $15,000 USD on Mainnet Ethereum, it should not take moving a mount to secure a loan using that Mainnet balance as collateral.

* If you want to bridge to a new network, you still have to figure out how to get the native token so that you have gas for the transactions you need to run.

Let's break this down:

Today, we have [CANTO](https://canto.io/) which is essentially a copy-pasta of Ethereum primitives offering 'liquidity as a service.' While the concept is very cool, getting up and running is far more difficult than it should be.

You have to:

1. Bridge from Ethereum to Canto
2. Convert from Canto to Canto EVM

Now, this is confusing for multiple reasons. First, you must move your assets to Canto. Yet, you don't get to stop there because you *aren't really* on Canto yet.

To get access to your tokens, you have to convert them from Canto to Canto EVM. There's just one problem, you don't have any of the native Canto token to cover the cost of gas. A real connundreum. The solution today? Go beg in Discord like a pleb that didn't just transfer $80k in assets willy nilly to a network you can't even use.
