# Youts

Youts are some super cute characters that are entirely on-chain art. Using an on-off switch for the light these little guys are dope and have a pretty nice contract. Unfortunately, traits are already determined and sequential minting was a pretty bad decision.

Because of this, we already have access to all of the metadata of the entire population.

## Profit Mechanism

Mostly just fun. Please don't ruin it for everyone <3

## Functions

Call the function on the metadata contract and get all the base64 metadata of the youts metadata using Alchemy.

## Summary

Simple strategy and knowledge of tech that allows us to get the metadata and images with little effort. For this, we just scraped the metadata and images and built a quick little frontend to display all of that data.
